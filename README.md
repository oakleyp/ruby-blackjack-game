# A Terminal BlackJack game in ruby

This game will currently only run with the following bash commands, executed in the bin folder:

```bash 
./blackjack Player TablePlayer
```

or 

```bash
# ./blackjack [starting cash] [minimum bet] Player TablePlayer
# ex:
./blackjack 500 80 Player TablePlayer
```

More options and functionality will be provided as this project progresses throughout the week.
